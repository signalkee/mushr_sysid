cost function used for path tracking

MPC cost function class for autonomous vehicle trajectory tracking using a bicycle model.

### Trajectory Setup
- **`set_trajectory(trajectory)`** -
- Sets reference path and goal waypoint
- **`get_reference_index(pose)`** 
- - Finds current target waypoint with 0.08 unit lookahead

### Cost Computation
**`running_cost(states, actions)`** 
- Returns instantaneous cost:
- Target tracking: Position (weight=1.0) + Heading (weight=2.0)
- Turn anticipation: Heading velocity cost (weight=5.0)
- Path following: Distance to trajectory using tangential_distance function (weight=1.5)
- Control effort: Throttle (0.001) + Steering (0.00001)
- Heading difference: Cost for alignment/orientation error in car and block

**`terminal_state_cost(s, a)`** 
- Final state cost (scaled 100x):
- Position error to goal (weight=1.0)
- Heading error to goal (weight=1.5)
- tan_dist(poses, trajectory) - Used for calculating perpendicular distance of pose from path segments


**`pushing_dynamics(states, actions)`** 
- - Bicycle model (wheelbase=0.295, dt=0.01)
  - State: [x, y, heading, block_x, block_y, block_heading]
  - Action: [steering_angle, speed]
